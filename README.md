# Hyper-star-time-series

Data, data and, data. Something that can be found everywhere, but what data is, and why it is a hot subject these days? Data, in summary, is information, information gathered by different sections of a company or different people in an organization, and the reason it is a hot subject these days is, businesses are using it to get insights about their performance in various fields. However, data by itself cannot do anything to keep a business afloat; it should be processed and analyzed in order to become suitable for reporting. Anyway, in this repo I want to share my insights derived from Hyper Starâ€™s stores dataset. In this repo, you can have access to 4 notebooks and their details to see how I reached to some results.
